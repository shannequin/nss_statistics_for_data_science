# Week 3 Exercises: Statistics for Data Science

### Part 1: Probability Calculations
1. You randomly select a card from a [standard 52-card deck of playing cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck).  
	a. What is the probability that you select a Jack?  
	b. What is the probability that you select a face card (Jack, Queen, or King)?  
	c. What is the probability that you select a Jack, given that you selected a face card? Are selecting a Jack and selecting a face card independent or dependent events?  
	d. What is the probability that you select a diamond?  
	e. What is the probability that you select a Jack, given that you selected a diamond? Are selecting a Jack and selecting a diamond independent or dependent events?

2. Say that there is a disease that is carried by 0.1% of the population. A test is developed which gives a positive result 98% of the time when a person has the disease. It also gives a positive result 3% of the time when a person does not have the disease.  
	a. What is the probability of a person having the disease and getting a positive result? (Hint: Use the formula for the joint probability which uses the conditional probability)  
	b. What is the probability of a person not having the disease and getting a positive result?  
	c. What is the probability of a person getting a positive result? (Hint: Add the probabilities from the previous two questions)  
	d. If you get tested and get a positive result, what is the probability that you have the disease? (Hint: Use Bayes' Theorem) 

### Part 2: Independence or Dependence of Variables
1. Let x be the event that it rains today and y be the event that it rained yesterday. Do you think that x and y are independent or dependent?
2. Use the data contained in the bna_rain.csv to evaluate your guess. Read this data into a DataFrame named `bna_rain`. The `rained_today` column indicates whether there was any precipitation on a given day and the `rained_yesterday` column indicates whether there was any precipitation the day before. **Hint:** If you want to filter the DataFrame down to the rows for days where it rained yesterday, you can use .loc: `bna_rain.loc[bna_rain['rained_yesterday']]`.
3. Let x be the event that it rains today and y be the event that it is Saturday. Do you think that x and y are independent or dependent? 
4. Use the data contained in the bna_rain.csv to evaluate your guess. You'll need to use the weekday, which is contained in the `day_of_week` column. **Hint:** If you want to filter the DataFrame down to the rows for Saturday, you can use .loc: `bna_rain.loc[bna_rain['day_of_week'] == 'Saturday']`.

### Part 3:  Binomial Distribution
According to Forbes [(https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2019/01/11/live-paycheck-to-paycheck-government-shutdown/#4693b2194f10)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2019/01/11/live-paycheck-to-paycheck-government-shutdown/#4693b2194f10), 78% of American workers live paycheck-to-paycheck.

1. You take a random sample of 10 American workers.  
	a. What is the probability that between 6 and 9 people (inclusive) in your sample are living paycheck-to-paycheck?  
	b. What is the probability that at least 9 people in your sample are living paycheck-to-paycheck?  
	c. What is the probability that 70% or fewer of people in your sample are living paycheck-to-paycheck?  
	d. What is the probability that 50% or fewer of people in your sample are living paycheck-to-paycheck?

2. You take a random sample of 100 American workers.  
	a. What is the probability that 70% or fewer of people in your sample are living paycheck-to-paycheck?  
	b. What is the probability that 50% or fewer of people in your sample are living paycheck-to-paycheck?

3. You take a random sample of 1000 American workers.  
	a. What is the probability that 70% or fewer of people in your sample are living paycheck-to-paycheck?  
	b. What is the probability that 50% or fewer of people in your sample are living paycheck-to-paycheck?

4. What do you notice happens as the size of your sample increases?

### Part 4: The Newton Problem 
Now, you will attempt to outdo Isaac Newton. See this video by Vsauce 2 for an entertaining description and analysis of the problem: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFlTawWwLZc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFlTawWwLZc). As described in the video, this is a problem which Isaac Newton got wrong. More precisely, he got the correct calculations, but his explanation was off. To be fair to Newton, the machinery of probability theory had not been developed yet in his time.

Use the binomial distribution to answer this question.
Which of the following three propositions has the greatest chance of success?    
	a. Six fair dice are tossed independently and at least one “6” appears.    
	b. Twelve fair dice are tossed independently and at least two “6”s appear.    
	c. Eighteen fair dice are tossed independently and at least three “6”s appear.  

### Part 5: The Normal Distribution
1. Using a standard normal distribution (mean 0, standard deviation 1), answer the following questions.  
	a. What percentage of outcomes are within one standard deviation of the mean?  
	b. What percentage of outcomes are within two standard deviations of the mean?  
	c. What percentage of outcomes are within three standard deviations of the mean?
2. How do your answers change to the previous question if you are using a normal distribution that has a different mean and/or standard deviation?
3. For this question, assume that the heights of men in the US are normally distributed with a mean of 70 inches and standard deviation of 3 inches.  
	a. If one man is chosen at random, what is the probability that his height is less than 66 inches tall?  
	b. If one man in chosen at random, what is the probability that his height is greater than 72 inches tall?  
	c. If one man is chosen at random, what is the probability that his height is between 68 and 72 inches?  
	d. If two men are chosen at random, what is the probability that both of them are between 68 and 72 inches tall? (Hint: You'll need to use your answer from the previous part plus the binomial distribution to answer this.)  
	e. If twenty-five men are chosen at random, what is the probability that all of them are between 68 and 72 inches tall?   
	f. Challenge Question - If two men are chosen at random, what is the probability that their __mean__ height is between 68 and 72 inches tall? (Hint: You'll probably have to simulate this to get an approximate answer. Similar to what we did to generate binomial random variables, we can generate normal random variables using `norm.rvs()`. For example, `norm.rvs(loc = 70, scale = 3, size = 2)` will generate two observations from a normal random variable with mean 70 and standard deviation 3. You can also give it a tuple. For example, `norm.rvs(loc = 70, scale = 3, size = (10,2))` will generate 10 pairs of observations.)  
	g. Challenge Question, Part 2 - If twenty-five men are chosen at random, what is the probability that their __mean__ height is between 68 and 72 inches tall?
